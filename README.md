descriptive and statistical) from sequencing data (R language)
To generate graphical analyses (descriptive and statistical) from sequencing data (R language recommended).
1) Plot a bar graph showing the absolute count of the 50 most abundant bacteria, grouped by time (day after weaning);

2) Plot a PCoA plot showing the clustering profile among the samples by day after weaning;

3) Use some metric that shows the differentially abundant bacteria between weaning days (edegR or DESeq2, for example). In a file (PDF, HTML, DOC or similar), describe the results obtained and explain what the criteria were for choosing the analytical methods used.
